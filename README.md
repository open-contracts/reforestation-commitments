# Reforestation Commitments

What if carbon credits actually represented a binding commitment to emissions reductions?
Let's find out! This contract allows anyone to deposit tokens, which can only be claimed by one of two persons:
- 1.) The President of Brazil, but only a small chunk in every month in which the Amazon Rainforest im Brazil grew sufficiently/ didn't shrink
- 2.) The Depositor, but only a chunk for which 1.) didn't happen.

TODOs: 
- Integrate 3D lidar measurements of forest structure from [GEDI ISS Module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Ecosystem_Dynamics_Investigation)
- Improve Mechanism Design, to the point where we can compute e.g. CO2 abatement per USDC invested
