# Reforestation Commitments

What if a carbon credit actually represented a binding commitment to emissions reductions?
Let's find out! This contract allows anyone to deposit a token into a contract which can only be claimed by one of two persons:
- 1.) The President of Brazil, but only a small chunk every month and only if the Amazon Rainforest im Brazil sufficiently increased in size
- 2.) The Depositor, but only a chunk for which 1.) didn't happen.
