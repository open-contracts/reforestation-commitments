# Reforestation Commitments

What if carbon credits actually represented a binding commitment to emissions reductions?
Let's find out! This contract allows anyone to deposit tokens, which can only be claimed by one of two persons:
  1. The [Government of Brazil](https://twitter.com/govbrazil) by [making an appropriate tweet](opencontracts.io/#/open-contracts/pay-a-twitter), but only a small chunk in every month in which the Amazon Rainforest im Brazil grew sufficiently/didn't shrink
  2. The Depositor, but only a chunk for which 1. didn't happen.

Why the President and not farmers? Well, the property rights for the Brazilian rainforest [seem to be assigned to the Brazilian state](https://spectator.clingendael.org/en/publication/who-owns-brazilian-rainforest).

TODOs: 
- Improve Mechanism Design, to the point where we can compute e.g. expected CO2 abatement per USDC invested and actually sell carbon credits
- Find a way to identify who actually owns a given piece of forest and incentivize 
- Integrate 3D lidar measurements of forest structure from [GEDI ISS Module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Ecosystem_Dynamics_Investigation)
