# Green Electricity Carbon Credit

The whole reforestation thing sounds cool initially, but it's plagued by difficulties
- what's the right counterfactual to use if no money was spent? (in CA, growers often "legally cheat" by assuming >80% deforestation!)
- how do you guarantee the funding is there when needed, but conditional on succeeding at reliably avoiding co2
- who owns which part of the forest and can claim responsibility for improvements

Solution: Let's use ppls energy bills instead!
- online, pw authentication = ownership
- cost for switch perfectly measurable (what is the price difference to cover for green energy)
- causal effect of incentive payment measurable (require registration first, proving you old provider, then provide regular evidence of green bills and get covered the price difference)
- high guarantee for resale
